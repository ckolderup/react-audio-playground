# audio-components

A fun place to prototype some different ways of interacting with music on the web.

## Components

* MusicWithCoverArt
  * a square piece of key art that you can click on to control a simple audio play/pause.

## Additional Features

* MusicPlayerContext
  * a React Context that provides a WebAudio AudioContext object to preserve resources and provide a smoother playback experience. Handles quality-of-life features like sitewide volume control and automatic pause of any playing audio when you start playing a different piece of audio.
